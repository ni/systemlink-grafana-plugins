### SystemLink Tags

This data source allows you to visualize both the current and historical values
of tags.

#### Query fields

**Query type** - Choose **Current** to visualize the tag's most recent value, or
**History** to visualize its values over time. Historical values will be
retrieved within the time range set on the dashboard and decimated according to
the width of the panel.

**Tag path** - The full path of the tag you want to visualize. You can input a
[variable](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/variables/) into
this field.

**Workspace** - The id of the workspace in which to search for the given tag
path. If left blank, the plugin finds the most recently updated tag in any
workspace.
