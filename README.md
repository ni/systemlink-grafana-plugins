# SystemLink Grafana Plugins
[![Push to
main](https://github.com/ni/systemlink-grafana-plugins/actions/workflows/push.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ni/systemlink-grafana-plugins/actions/workflows/push.yml)

Grafana plugins for visualizing data from [SystemLink
Enterprise](https://www.ni.com/docs/en-US/bundle/systemlink-enterprise/page/systemlink-enterprise.html).

## Description

This project contains a set of data sources and panel plugins bundled as an [app
plugin](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/plugin-management/#app-plugins),
scaffolded using the [Grafana Plugin
Tools](https://grafana.github.io/plugin-tools/).

### Data sources

- [Data frames](src/datasources/data-frame/)
- [Notebooks](src/datasources/notebook/)
- [Systems](src/datasources/system/)
- [Tags](src/datasources/tag/)
- [Assets](src/datasources/asset/)
- [Products](src/datasources/products/)
- [Results](src/datasources/results/)
- [Work orders](src/datasources/work-orders/)
- [Test plans](src/datasources/test-plans/)

### Panels

- [Plotly.js chart](src/panels/plotly/)

## Contributing

If you're at NI, request to be granted access to the repo. Outside contributors
can use a fork & pull workflow.

### Getting started

If you're on Windows, you'll need to first [set up WSL](#wsl-setup). Building
requires [Node.js + npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/install)
(20.x is the node version used in build pipelines), and
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) is used to run the Grafana
server in a container for development.

After cloning the repo, `npm install` to fetch dependencies and then `npm run start` to build in development mode. This command does two things:

1. Starts a process that
   watches for changes to the source code and automatically rebuilds.
1. Starts up Grafana in a container with the `./dist` directory
   created by the build process mounted. After a brief startup, you should now
   be able to access the Grafana UI at http://localhost:3000.

Alternatively, if you use VS Code as your editor, this repo contains a launch
configuration that runs the steps above and then attaches to an instance of
Chrome for debugging. See [Debugging in Visual Studio
Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging) for more information.

For panel plugins, there's no extra configuration needed - it will automatically
show up in the list of available visualizations.

### Data source configuration

For data source plugins, some manual configuration is required to have it
connect to a SystemLink service running in the cloud.

1. Navigate to the data sources configuration page (`/datasources`). You can get
   there by clicking the gear icon in the sidebar.
2. Select **Add data source**. Search for the plugin in the list and click on it
   to enter the data source settings view.
3. Fill in the **URL** field with the API URL of the Stratus environment you
   want to use (e.g. https://test-api.lifecyclesolutions.ni.com).
4. For authentication, click the **Add header** button and add a custom header
   with the name `x-ni-api-key` and value set to [an API
   key](https://ni-staging.zoominsoftware.io/docs/en-US/bundle/systemlink-enterprise/page/creating-an-api-key.html)
   for the SLE instance.
5. Click **Save & test**. You should see **Success** pop up if the data source
   was configured correctly and the API key grants the necessary privileges.

You should now be able to use the data source when building a dashboard or in
the Explore mode. Navigating to Explore is the easiest way to begin testing the
plugin.

### Testing

If you followed the steps above, a live reload script was injected into the
Grafana frontend. Any time the plugin rebuilds, the page will automatically
refresh and load the new bundle.

Run `npm run test` to launch the unit tests in watch mode.

Run `npm run e2e` to run the integration tests.

### Submitting changes

Once you're ready to submit changes to a plugin, all you need to do is open a
pull request on GitHub to merge your branch. Don't forget to resolve any lint
errors (`npm run lint:fix`) and ensure that the [tests are passing](#testing)
locally.

The repo uses
[semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/) and a
[GitHub workflow](.github/workflows/push.yml) to automate the versioning and
release process. For this to work, commits to `main` need to follow a specific
message format.

#### Commit message format

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>
  │       │             │
  │       │             └─⫸ Summary in present tense. Not capitalized. No period at the end.
  │       │
  │       └─⫸ Commit Scope: If your change applies to a single plugin, put its short name
  │                          as the scope (e.g. tag, notebook, system).
  │
  └─⫸ Commit Type: build|ci|docs|feat|fix|perf|refactor|test
```

The `<type>` and `<summary>` fields are mandatory, the `(<scope>)` field is
optional.

`<type>` must be one of the following:

| Type | When to use | Automatic version bump |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `build` | Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies | None |
| `ci` | Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts | None |
| `docs` | Documentation only changes | None |
| `feat` | A new feature | Minor |
| `fix` | A bug fix | Maintenance |
| `perf`| A code change that improves performance | None |
| `refactor`| A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature | None |
| `test`| Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests | None |
| `chore` | Changes that don't fit into the above categories | None |

For example, if you're making a bug fix to the [Data
frame](src/datasources/data-frame/) plugin, your PR title (and therefore the
commit message when merging into `main`) would be something like:

`fix(data-frame): prevent crash when user hits their head on the keyboard`

Note that none of the `<type>` values will automatically trigger a major version bump. To force a new major version bump, you must put `BREAKING CHANGE: <breaking change summary>` in the footer of the commit. Follow the [commit message format](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/contributing-docs/commit-message-guidelines.md#commit-message-footer) outlined in the Angular docs.

### WSL setup

The [plugin tools](https://grafana.github.io/plugin-tools/) provided by Grafana
do not currently support Windows. However, you can still set up the plugin and
run commands inside a [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/)
environment.

1. [Enable WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). If you
   installed Docker Desktop, it's likely already enabled. Run `wsl --update` to
   make sure it's up to date.
2. If you don't have a distribution installed, run `wsl --install -d ubuntu` to
   install Ubuntu. Note that your distro needs to be on WSL 2 for Docker to
   work.
3. Open Docker Desktop. Go to **Settings > Resources > WSL Integration** and
   **Enable integration with additional distros**.
4. Open a shell in your Linux environment. [Windows
   Terminal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install) is
   recommended for seamlessly managing multiple command lines.
5. [Install
   Node.js](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-wsl).

You can now follow the [setup steps](#getting-started). Make sure that you're
running the commands in your Linux environment. The [WSL
extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-vscode)
for Visual Studio Code is recommended to simplify development.

### Creating a new plugin

To create a new data source, run `npm run generate` in the root directory and
follow the instructions.
